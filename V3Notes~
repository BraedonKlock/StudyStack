Program

notes are not attached to courses because i want to be able to delete courses but keep notes.
everytime a course is added it creates a notes folder and a vim CourseInfo file.
Notes are printed in color 

user can "create note"
- Program asks which course its for, then asks for file name it then opens vim while passing file name as an argument and saves it to corresponding
 course

user can "Edit note"

user can Delete note"

user can view note
- Program lists courses and asks which course. Program then lists notes to view

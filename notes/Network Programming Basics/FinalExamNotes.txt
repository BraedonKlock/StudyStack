~ Cross over cable used for NIC to NIC 
	- There is no NIC in a switch

~ Classes
	- Class a first bit is:	     0
	- Class b first 2  bits are: 10
	- Class c first 3 bits are:  110

~ ARP protocol is used to find a MAC address corresponding to a given IP
address

~ TCP and UDP programming

~ A data blck with its headers is called a Protocol Data Unit (PDU)

~ What is the name of the PDU at each layer
	- frame is the dataLink layer
	- segment is transport layer
	- Packet is network layer
	
~ The dataLink layer encapsulates the packet

~ IP addresses are added during encapsulation at layer 3 (network)

~ MAC addressed are added during encapsulation at layer 2 (Datalink)

~ Routing is done at layer 3 (network)

~ TTL is found in layer 3 (network)

~ Ethernet encapsulation encapsulates the destination MAC source MAC and Ether
type

~ Ether types 
	- IPV4 0x0800
	- ARP 0X0806


~ Collision and Broadcast domains
	- Collision is between pc and switch
	- broadcast between routers - routers  and routers - switches




~ The number of destination MAC addresses is determined by hops and end device
~ How many Arp requests depends on how many local networks there are

	PC0-----SWITCH0----ROUTER0----ROUTER1-----SWITCH1-----PC1
 3 ARP requests because there are 3 local networks. 3 destination MAC addresses




~ What does tracert provide that ping doesn't?
	- tracert shows the number of hops

~ What are the componentts of a MAC address?
	- 1st 3 bytes are OUI and the last 3 bytes are a unique number

~ IPV6 
	- unicast 
	- anycast (Not equivalent to broadcast) 

~ What is the purpose of the ACK and seq
	- seq  order of packets recieved 
	- ack is to confirm the packet was recieved

~ What packet sequence does TCP use to set up a connection SYN,SYN-ACK,ACK
~ What packet sequence does TCP use to take down a connection FIN, ACK

~ TTL is found in layer 3 network

~ What field in the incoming packet does a router use to forward it to the
outgoing interface?
	- IP destination address

~ The four messages involved in a DHCP configuration?
	-Discover,Offer,Request,Ack

~ Which commands are based on the ICMP protocol?
	- Ping and Trace Route

~ What are the 7 layers of the OSI protocol stack
7. Application
6. Presentation
5. Sesion
4. Transport
3. Network
2. Data Link
1. Physical

~ The purpose of the seq # and ack #  in the TCP and UDP protocols are
reliability, segments can be placed in the proper order. Confirmation that
each segment has been recieved. Retransmission as required.

~ Application lay eprotocols that use 
TCP: FTP,HTTP,HTTPS,POP3
UDP: TFTP,DNS,DHCP,VoIP

~ Half duplex sending and recieving happens one at a time
~ Full duplex sending and recieving happens at the same time

HTTP(S) TRANSFERS FILES
	- well known port: 80

What does NAT change when a packet enters the external /public network?
	- Source IP

~ A PC sends a TCP window size of 0. What does this mean?
	- The PC cannot recieve any data
